MAJOR ISSUES:

FIXED - Bug - live args get added each run instead of reset - both functions and scripts
        Problem - Modifying list and dict references to function args
	Solution - Copy lists and dicts and modify copies

FIXED - Bug - Input script sometimes prints everythin to browser (thread bug?)
        Trigger - Behavior starts after any exception
        Problem - Exceptions prevent normal print from being restored in redirect_print
	Solution - Finally clause added

FIXED - Bug - Entering blank input hangs script
        Problem - wait_for_input doesn't trigger when empty string is returned
	Solution - On blank input, return '**BLANK_INPUT_RECEIVED**'

DONE - Feature: Replace redefine print with: __builtins__.print = web_print

DONE - Feature: Enable input functions.

TO DO - Feature: Move all config stuff to config dict


MINOR ISSUES:

DONE - Investigate: Check if threading causes print bugs
       (same interpreter? Switch to multiprocessing?)
       Solution: Switched to multiprocessing for other reasons
       
DONE - Investigate: Check if processes need to be terminated
       (with threading) - is_alive() useful for this?
       Solution: Switched to multiprocessing so processes can be terminated

Issue: Investigate: Some input functions / scripts might not always use the input call.
       Better way than just setting detect=False or a low timeout?
       Seems to already work, why?

DONE - Feature: web_print needs to deal with same kwargs as print, if only to ignore them
       Solution: Implemented sep, end and file kwargs. Ignored flush kwarg.

TO DO - Feature: Add customizable input prompt for browser_input.html

DONE - Clean up: Remove all detectable stuff from autotest create_route calls

TO DO - Clean up: Put imports in alphabetical order
