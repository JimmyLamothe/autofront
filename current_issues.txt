For Alpha version 0.3

MAJOR ISSUES:


TO DO - Compatibility: Fix Posix path for compatibility with python 3.5

TO DO - Compatibility: Fix scripts to work with Windows.
        Progress: Raw string solution implemented for Windows. Still more needed

DONE - Bug: Fix multiprocessing for change to spawn from fork. Protect main module
       and fix or cancel atexit deletion.
       Solution: Added child process counter to identify main process
       Solution: Use atexit to decrement child processes and only run on main exit

DONE - Bug: Fix pickle bug for scripts with spawn multiprocessing
       Idea: Rewrite wrap_script as a decorator? Inner function is the problem.
       Solution: wrap_script run in child process instead of in parent

MINOR ISSUES:







For Alpha version 0.2

MAJOR ISSUES:

TO DO - Documentation: Revise all docs, docstrings and code comments to conform
      	to new changes and features

TO DO - Clean up: Revise code before finalizing version
      	Note: Check if with functools.wraps still needs to change function name


FIXED - Bug - live args get added each run instead of reset - both functions and scripts
        Problem - Modifying list and dict references to function args
	Solution - Copy lists and dicts and modify copies

FIXED - Bug - Input script sometimes prints everythin to browser (thread bug?)
        Trigger - Behavior starts after any exception
        Problem - Exceptions prevent normal print from being restored in redirect_print
	Solution - Finally clause added

FIXED - Bug - Entering blank input hangs script
        Problem - wait_for_input doesn't trigger when empty string is returned
	Solution - On blank input, return '**BLANK_INPUT_RECEIVED**'

DONE - Feature: Replace redefine print with: __builtins__.print = web_print

DONE - Feature: Enable input functions.

DONE - Feature: Move all config stuff to config dict.

DONE - Feature: All functions run using multiprocessing.
       Idea: Same for scripts. Fixes atexit cleanup problem?
       By default, terminated after 'timeout' seconds.
       Outcome: Works great. Now possible to let functions run in background.
       Atexit cleanup problem was different but is still fixed.

DONE - Feature: Modify HTML template so it works well on phones
       Far from perfect but okay for first alpha version    

DONE - Test: Custom template folders work correctly

DONE - Test: Duplicate titles are dealt with correctly

DONE - Test: Custom static folders work correctly

DONE - Bug: join should set timeout to None

DONE - Feature: Add top kwarg to initialize to print to top of functions.html

DONE - Investigate: Prevent multiple join-type function calls?
       Issue : Presently possible to call function twice while waiting for join
       Fixed: Added status dictionary with 'waiting' flag

MINOR ISSUES:

TO DO - Bug - Display cleared when clicking on page while waiting for function
        to resolve.
      	Idea - Use 'waiting flag' to prevent clearing display
	Failed - Clicking forces page to reload before function writes to display.
	Idea - Function completion forces page to reload? redirect(url_for(function))?
	Create timed function to test (writes every second)

TO DO - Confirm print_return_value change in multi.py didn't affect anything

TO DO - Investigate - Exceptions now always print to console. Why?
      	Clue - Started with switch to multiprocessing for all scripts and functions.
	Idea: Exceptions in multiprocessing don't cause main program exit?

TO DO - Feature: Add customizable input prompt for browser_input.html

DONE - Issue - cleanup name conflict between utilities and multi
       Solution - Renamed multi version to cleanup_workers

DONE - Feature: Move cleanup to exit instead of start
       Problem: atexit.register is called after subprocess exits (probably)
       Idea: Find a T/F test that differentiates subprocess exit and main exit
       Solution: Set a flag in local file to test if script is running before
       executing the cleanup function.

DONE - Investigate: Some input functions / scripts might not always use the input call.
       Better way than just setting detect=False or a low timeout?
       Seems to already work, why?
       Answer: Works fine because as soon as script is finished prompt is written
       and browser_input sees whether it's the end of the script or an input.
       No need to do anything special.
  
DONE - Investigate: Check if threading causes print bugs
       (same interpreter? Switch to multiprocessing?)
       Solution: Switched to multiprocessing for other reasons
       
DONE - Investigate: Check if processes need to be terminated
       (with threading) - is_alive() useful for this?
       Solution: Switched to multiprocessing so processes can be terminated

DONE - Feature: web_print needs to deal with same kwargs as print, if only to ignore them
       Solution: Implemented sep, end and file kwargs. Ignored flush kwarg.

DONE - Clean up: Remove all detectable stuff from autotest create_route calls

DONE - Feature: Make initialize automatic with default settings

DONE - Clean up: Put imports in alphabetical order - Check if still used

DONE - Clean up: Move route_dicts somewhere they don't need to be put in function calls.
      	Idea: Put in config?

DONE - Feature: Add timeout to route dicts - set individually to override main setting

DONE  - Investigate: Check if multiprocessing workers need function name
      	Answer: Now assigned in create_process
	
DONE - Move 'waiting' logic in to clear_display instead of its calls.


For Alpha version 0.2

TO DO - Feature: Document free safe way to deploy to web

TO DO - Feature: Special routes for headers, other HTML stuff?

TO DO - Feature: Add dropdown menu option

TO DO - Feature: Joinable input functions and scripts if possible

TO DO - Feature: If main launch browser with correct ip address

TO DO - Feature: If main get correct ip for phone and display it when launching browser


Future use cases:

Schools - Players - Raspberry Pi - Remotes
